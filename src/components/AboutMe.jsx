            Hello! My name is Ian and since I was a child I was into creating
            things that involves computer. My interest in web development
            started back in 2019 when I teamed up with other developers to build
            a new lending system for the company. They introduce me to web
            development and some of more technical side of computer which awaken
            the passion that was inside me.

            Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of learning at an
            intensive bootcamp that covers programming fundamentals, full-stack
            web development, learning about both front-endand back-end
            programming. The bootcamp requires learners to complete multiple
            hands-on projects.
